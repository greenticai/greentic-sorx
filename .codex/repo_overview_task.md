# Repo Overview Maintenance

Maintain `.codex/repo_overview.md` as a current machine- and human-readable summary of this repository.

## Required Routine

1. Scan the project structure and identify top-level components, crates, packages, services, workflows, and scripts.
2. Inspect main entrypoints, public APIs, tests, examples, and docs to infer what is actually implemented.
3. Search for TODO/WIP/stub markers including `TODO`, `FIXME`, `XXX`, `HACK`, `NOTE`, `BROKEN`, `TEMP`, `unimplemented!`, `todo!`, and equivalent placeholders.
4. Run obvious non-destructive build and test commands, especially `ci/local_check.sh` when present.
5. Fully refresh `.codex/repo_overview.md`; do not append stale or conflicting information.

## Required Headings

- `# Repository Overview`
- `## 1. High-Level Purpose`
- `## 2. Main Components and Functionality`
- `## 3. Work In Progress, TODOs, and Stubs`
- `## 4. Broken, Failing, or Conflicting Areas`
